#Just trying to make a pull request for HAcktoberfest 2022
This is the repo where we will upload our code and everything as we go. 
It's better this way because once you will upload your work, everyone else can
see it easily without emailing each other and stuff. Will also help in keeping a log of everything.

To know how to use github, you can just watch any youtube tutorial or something, anything.
And as demo, any code you have written till now, just upload that in this repo. Make sure your file names
are self explanatory so that others can understand.

Basically learn the following commands:
1. git clone
2. git Push
3. git Pull
4. git Commit
5. git add
6. git status
7. git log
8. git reset

The way you do this is,
1. you make some changes to the repo.
2. you go to gitbash, and check status.
3. you stage your changes if you feel like they are it.
4. you commit it
5. you push it to the existing repo

Initially you'll have to clone the repository but 
after that its pretty easy.
